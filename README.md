This repository comprise a detailed worklfow of the research work performed, with each data and script used during the study. This repository does not presents an automated pipeline but how to reproduce similar results than those of the scientific paper separatly: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11204244/ It also presents a innovative method to compare and understand the differences between variants in interacting with a complex partner.
